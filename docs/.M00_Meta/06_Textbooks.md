# Textbooks

Enough material will be posted on this website to enable you to complete
the course, but if you are an information glutton who enjoys devouring
multiple information resources there are several good online books
available:

-   [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer
    Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) by
    Allen B. Downey. A simple and clear text. The presentation in this
    book is closest to my presentation of the course material, though a
    couple of topics are covered out of sequence. It does not cover as
    much material as our course, but is a useful supplement for the
    material it does cover.

-   [Learn Python The Hard Way, 2nd
    Edition](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html). This one
    is for hands-on learners: it emphasizes typing code examples in.

-   [Hands-On Python: A Tutorial Introduction for
    Beginners](http://www.cs.luc.edu/%7Eanh/python/hands-on/handsonHtml/handson.html)
    by Andrew N. Harrington. Has the least-polished on-screen
    presentation, but solid information. All on one HTML page so you can
    use Ctrl-F to search it easily.

-   [Dive into Python](http://diveintopython.net/toc/index.html) by Mark
    Pilgrim. Excellent, but advanced. Assumes you already know how to
    program in some language. Most useful once you have completed Part I
    of this course.
