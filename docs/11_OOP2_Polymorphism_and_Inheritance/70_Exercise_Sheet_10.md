# Tutorial 10

1.  ### Add inheritance to your monster (vampire, zombie, Sith, etc.)

    Take the monster class you wrote in tutorial 8. Adjust it so that it inherits
    from the `Monster` class we wrote in lecture. Upload your code to the help
    centre so that I can test it all in a large monster attack. Make sure that 
    your code it well commented and that your tests will not run if I import them
    to another module (using `__main__`).

    The class should have a modified `__init__` method (if necessary), an `__str__` 
    method, and a modified attack method.


2.  ### Fractions

    Finish the `Fraction` class we wrote together in lecture. The final code 
    should have addition, subtraction, multiplication, indexing, str, and all
    the equality operators (lt,le,eq,ge,gt).
