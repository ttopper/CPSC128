# Tutorial 2

1. Figure out what each program will print if the input is the number `-5`.

a)
```python
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
if num > 0:
    print(num)
```

b)
```python
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num*2)
else:
    print(num**2)
```

c)
```python
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
if num > 0 and num % 2 == 0:
    print("I'm positive it's even!")
elif num > 0:
    print("I'm positive it's odd!")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zip zero nada!")
elif num < 0 and num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even if it's negative?")
else:
    print("Even if it's odd?")
    
```

2. Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints the absolute value of that number (so if it is a negative number, it will switch it to a positive number before it prints).                              


3.  ### Is it a triangle?

    Write a program that accepts three numerical values and outputs a
    message indicating whether they could represent the lengths of the
    sides of a triangle or not. Look up the **triangle inequality theorem** 
    to help you design your program.

    A sample run might look like this,

        =================
        Is it a triangle?
        -----------------
        Enter your first value: 4
        Enter the second value: 9
        Enter the third value: 3
        I'm afraid those three numbers could NOT represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.


**Optional**. Write a program that gets an integer from the user. It should then print the number with the appropriate suffix (i.e. 552 would be **552nd**. For example if the user entered the number 1, you would print 1st. You can use the modulo operator to figure out the appropriate suffix for each number. `num % 10 == 1` will return `True` if the last digit is 1. For your first try ignore numbers that end in 11th, 12th, and 13th which are weird cases because they donâ€™t use 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Below is the pseudocode.


        Get the number as input from the user
        Check to see if the number ends in a 1
            print the number with 'st' at the end
        Otherwise check to see if the number ends in a 2
            print the number with 'nd' at the end
        Otherwise check to see if the number ends in a 3
            print the number with 'rd' at the end
        Otherwise
            print the number with 'th' at the end
