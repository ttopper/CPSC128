# Ode to Pythagoras

## Problem:
Write a program that accepts three integer values, and outputs a message stating whether they could be the sides of a right-angled triangle or not.

(The relevant math is Pythagoras' theorem, and since it has come up: you cannot specify the order in which the values are to be entered).

Sample runs:

    Enter the lengths of the sides of your triangle and I will tell you
    if it has a right angle or not.
    Length of first side = 3
    Length of second side = 4
    Length of third side = 5
    That is a right-angled triangle.
    Enter the lengths of the sides of your triangle and I will tell you
    if it has a right angle or not.
    Length of first side = 3
    Length of second side = 5
    Length of third side = 4
    That is a right-angled triangle.
    Enter the lengths of the sides of your triangle and I will tell you
    if it has a right angle or not.
    Length of first side = 3
    Length of second side = 4
    Length of third side = 6
    That is NOT a right-angled triangle.
