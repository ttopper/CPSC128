# The Problem

At Yukon University numerical grades are converted to letter grades
using a conversion chart. The values are as follows:

| Numerical Grade |  Letter Grade |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| 95-100          |  A+           |
| 86-94           |  A            |
| 80-85           |  A-           |
| 75-79           |  B+           |
| 70-74           |  B            |
| 65-69           |  B-           |
| 62-64           |  C+           |
| 58-61           |  C            |
| 55-57           |  C-           |
| 50-54           |  D            |
| 0-50            |  F            |
  
We would like to write a program that accepts a numerical grade and
outputs a letter grade.
