# Course Schedule

Online-only: This course is semi-self-paced meaning you have some, but not complete,
discretion over the pace you set for yourself. Specifically __there is a
minimum speed of one module per week__, but no maximum speed, so you can
get a little ahead to create a cushion for yourself, or even finish the
entire course early.

The first two modules contain a lot of reading, and some busy work, but
are not very challenging otherwise. So these are actually good weeks to
try and get ahead!
