# Summary

The most common programming model is imperative programming which
conceives of a program as a set of instructions issued to the computer.

There are only six+1 key instruction types:

Three elementary ones:

_input_
:   gets a value from the input stream and stores it in memory,

_processing_
:   processes/combines/manipulates values stored in memory and stores
    the result in memory,

_output_
:   sends a value to the output stream.

and four control structures:

_sequential processing_
:   in which statements are executed one at a time in sequence,

_selection_
:   in which one group of statements or another, but not both, are
    executed,

_repetition_
:   in which a group of statements is executed repeatedly,

_modularity_
:   in which code is broken into chunks that can be named and
    manipulated.
