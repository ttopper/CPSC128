# Big Picture 2: Computers and Programs

**Q:** Well what about computers? What are they, and how do computer
scientists use them?

**A:** A computer is a machine that manipulates symbols.

**Q:** What is a symbol?

**A:** Any discrete entity can be thought of as a symbol. Common symbols
are letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and strings of characters.

One important implication of this is that computers can be used to
manipulate anything that can be represented symbolically.

**Q:** How does the computer manipulate the symbols?

**A:** According to rules.

**Q:** What rules?

**A:** The rules you—the programmer—specify.

**Q:** How do I do that?

**A:** First you find/develop a computational procedure that solves the
problem at hand. (This is known as an algorithm).

Next you write that procedure as a computer program.

Then you load it into the computer.

Finally you run/execute the program enabling it take control of the
computer and its resources, and admire your handiwork.

**Q:** Great. But what's a program?

**A:** A list of instructions telling the computer what to do.
