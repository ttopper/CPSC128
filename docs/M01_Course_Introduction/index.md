# Introduction: The big picture ðŸ”­

This week focusses on the Big Picture of Computer Science, and we just dip our toes into Python itself. With the big picture clear in our minds the remaining weeks of the course focus on Python and programming. 

This week's assignment is quite different from all the others in the course. Assignment 1 is somewhat artificial, because I need a way to know that you have read the things I ask you to, so it has short answer questions, and an exercise as well. The remaining assignments are more natural and authentic since they all ask you to write programs.

Have a good week, and I Iook forward to hearing from you, and seeing your work.

p.s. My goal is to always respond to email during the week within 24 hours. If I haven't it's probably because I've overlooked your message. Please give me a nudge if that happens!
