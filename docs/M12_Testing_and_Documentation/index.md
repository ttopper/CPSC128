# Introduction: Testing and documentation üïµÔ∏è

Last (substantive) module of the course! Well except for that pesky exam. No heavy lifting in this module, just two non-programming software development topics.

The first is a way to document our OOP designs using diagrams: Unified Modeling Language (UML).

The second is a way to embed tests of our methods in our Python code which makes them easy to run when we "improve" that code, and makes our programs more self-documenting since it shows the exact behaviour we are expecting of our code.
