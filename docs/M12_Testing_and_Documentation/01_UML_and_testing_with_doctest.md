# UML and Testing with doctest

We are all but done. There will be no heavy lifting in this module, no
complex algorithms or complex data structures to sort out, but there are
a couple of important topics for us to cover.

-   The first is the use of UML class diagrams as both design aid and
    documentation of our OO designs.
-   The second is Python's `doctest` module.
