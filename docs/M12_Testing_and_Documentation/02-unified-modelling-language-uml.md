# Unified Modelling Language (UML)

UML stands for Unified* Modeling Language. Rather than being a spoken
(like English) or written (like Python) language UML specifies
a_graphical_language for describing the production of software. UML
includes 13 kinds of diagrams that provide for the depiction of business
processes, database schemas, project activities and programming language
statements. We are just going to use one of them, [UML class
diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram), and we'll look
at them in a slightly simplified form.

The goal of a class diagram is to summarize the characteristics of
individual classes, and the relationships between them. This means that
for individual classes we want to show each class' name, attributes and
methods. As for the relationship between classes we want to show
"is-a" (or inheritance) and "has-a" (or composition) relationships.

* The word "unified" appears in the name because UML was the
unification of several competing systems. As usual you can find [a
useful summary and
background](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) on
Wikipedia.
