# Introduction: Object-oriented programming üéÅ

Welcome to the home stretch of the course. You're two thirds of the way through, and the final module is a light one, so there are
only three more modules of substantive content left!

These modules cover Object-Oriented Programming or OOP. Don't worry, it's not something brand new and different, just a way of packaging the algorithms and data structures you've been working with into larger chunks called _objects_. This makes them even easier to reuse and to connect together into larger programs.

There _is_ some new notation and jargon, so to help you concentrate on that we'll revisit a programming domain we've already seen, playing cards, and repackage our techniques and data structures for dealing with them into classes and objects. We'll develop a set of playing card classes in this module. Be sure to follow that development carefully, since three of your four assignment problems involve it.

(Next week we'll consider a new problem domain that has been students' favourite assignment over the years, the world of the original text adventure game "Hunt the Wumpus".)
