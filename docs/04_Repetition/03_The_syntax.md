# The syntax

Python provides two repetition statements, `while` and `for`. We will
consider `while` first. The syntax for the `while` statement is,

<pre>    <b>while</b> <i>test-expression</i> <b>:</b>
        <i>statement</i>
</pre>

Or, in words, the `while` statement consists of the
keyword `while` followed by a test expression, terminated by a colon,
followed by a statement (simple or compound) that will be executed as
long as the text expression is `True`. Note that the statement(s)
following while **must** be indented.
