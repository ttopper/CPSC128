In the discussing the big picture of programming I offered you the
following,

To be a little more specific the process of writing a computer program
usually involves:

1.  Solving the problem by hand to make sure we know how.

2.  Consciously identifying our solution method, i.e. algorithm.

3.  Translating that algorithm into Python.

4.  Entering and running the resulting program, and verifying that it
    works.

These are the steps we will follow throughout this course as we develop
programs.
