# Example: Making change

## Problem:

Write a program that makes change, i.e. given a number of cents of change to make it will say what coins to use (using as few coins as possible). This was the first lab I ever did as a computer science student (it was slightly less complicated because we could use pennies)! A sample run might look like:

```plaintext
    How much change do you have to make (in cents)? 197
    195 cents can be made using:
    0 twonies
    1 loonies
    3 quarters
    2 dimes
    0 nickels
```
