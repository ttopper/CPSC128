# Beaufort Scale

## Problem:

Write a program that inputs the speed of the wind in miles/hour and outputs the corresponding Beaufort description, e.g. "Gentle Breeze", or "Violent Storm". You can find a table giving the Beaufort Scale Specifications at http://www.zetnet.co.uk/sigs/weather/Met_Codes/beaufort.htm

    Enter the wind speed in miles per hour (ideally measured 10 m off the ground): 52.8
    
        A wind speed of 52.8 mph corresponds to Force 9  or "Severe Gale".

## Solution:
