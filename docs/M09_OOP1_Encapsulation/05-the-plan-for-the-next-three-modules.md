# The plan for the next three modules

The three characteristics of OOP fit closely together, but encapsulation
is the most common in day-to-day programming and so is the focus of this
unit and the next one. Inheritance and polymorphism both involve
fussier, more detailed, syntax and are less commonly encountered, so I
have delayed a thorough examination of them until Module 11. Each module
is built around a main example:

-   Module 9: Playing cards
-   Module 10: Hunt the Wumpus
-   Module 11: Rational Numbers (Fractions)
