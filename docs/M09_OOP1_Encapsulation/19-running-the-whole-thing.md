# Running the whole thing

Putting all the pieces together and running the resulting module
produces the output,

    >>> 
    d after shuffling = 3 of Hearts, 2 of Spades, 4 of Diamonds, Q of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, 
    9 of Hearts, 4 of Spades, 9 of Diamonds, A of Diamonds, A of Clubs, K of Hearts, 
    2 of Clubs, 5 of Hearts, K of Clubs, T of Spades, 3 of Diamonds, A of Hearts, 
    Q of Hearts, 3 of Clubs, J of Spades, J of Diamonds, J of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds, 
    9 of Spades, T of Diamonds, 3 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 8 of Spades, 
    4 of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds, A of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, K of Spades, 
    4 of Hearts, 6 of Diamonds, Q of Spades, 6 of Spades, T of Clubs, 2 of Hearts, 
    7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, K of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 6 of Clubs, J of Clubs, 
    T of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, 5 of Spades, Q of Diamonds, 7 of Spades,  
    d has 52 cards.
    Your hand of 5 cards contains: 7 of Spades, Q of Diamonds, 5 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, T of Hearts, 
    Your hand of 5 cards contains: 5 of Clubs, K of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 6 of Clubs, J of Clubs, 
    There are 42 cards left in the deck.
    >>> 

Which is what we had hoped for when we first wrote our spec code
indicating that our module is complete.
