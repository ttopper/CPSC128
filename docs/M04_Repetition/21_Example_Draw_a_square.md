# Example: Draw a square

Write a program that reads in the size of a square and a character and then prints out a hollow square of that size using the specified character and blanks. Your program should work for squares of all sizes from 1 to 20 inclusive. Here is a sample run of the program,

    What size square? 5
    What character? *
    *****
    *   *
    *   *
    *   *
    *****
