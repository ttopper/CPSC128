# Infinite Loops

![Python code that prints Hi! an infinite
times.](05_infinite_loop.py.png)

This code looks very similar, but instead of printing `Hi!` 3 times it
will go on printing it forever. That is because the value in `i` is never
updated so the `i <= 3` condition will **always** evaluate toÂ `True`.
