# Python Formatting Guidelines

## Why have guidelines?

A style guide provides provides a map so that the code generated by a group of programmers will be consistent and, therefore, easier to read and maintain. †

It is also an essential part of joining a community, and as with most communities the rules vary. In the case of programming they vary across languages, and even across major projects or companies using a language, e.g.

C++: [GeoSoft's](http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html), [Google's](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml),
[Java](http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html),
[PHP](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.html),
[C#](http://www.csharpfriends.com/Articles/getArticle.aspx?articleID=336),
[Perl](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlstyle.html),
[Ruby](http://www.caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml#style),
and of course, [Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## CPSC 128 Python Guidelines

These are extracted from the Python guidelines above, so you will not
have to wade through too many language features you won't recognize.

-   Use four spaces for indentation. (IDLE does this for you. If you're
    using another editor, set it to use four space characters, not a tab
    character).

-   Limit lines to 80 characters.

-   Separate logical sections of a program with single blank lines.

-   Begin every program with an opening comment block containing at
    least:

        # filename
        # Author
        # Date

-   Place import statements right after the opening comment block.

-   Initialize variables as near their first use as possible.

-   Do not leave a space between `input` and its opening `(`.

-   Do not leave a space after ( or before ).

-   Place a single space on each side of the binary
    operators `=`, `==`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`, `<>`, `>=`, `>`, `and`, `or`, `not`,
    and `in`. Use spaces around arithmetic operators too, though in long
    expressions using grouping for readability takes precedence.

-   Comments should be complete sentences.

-   Comments should add to the code not repeat it, and should never
    state the obvious.

-   Variable names should be lower_case.

-   Constant names should be UPPER_CASE.
