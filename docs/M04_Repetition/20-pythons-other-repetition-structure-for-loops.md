# Python's other repetition structure: `for` loops

As an early page in this module mentioned, Python provides a pair of
repetition constructs. In addition to `while` Python provides
the `for` statement. Its syntax is brief,

<pre>    <b>for</b> <i>item</i> <b>in</b> <i>sequence</i> <b>:</b>
        <i>statement</i>
</pre>

We read the statement above as saying “for
each item in this sequence execute the following statement”. As with
the `while` loop _statement_ may a single simple statement or a
multipart compound statement.
