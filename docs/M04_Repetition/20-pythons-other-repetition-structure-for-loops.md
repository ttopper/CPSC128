# Python's other repetition structure: `for` loops

As an early page in this module mentioned Python provides a pair of
repetition constructs. In addition to `while` Python provdes
the `for` statement. Its syntax is brief,

    for item in sequence:
        statement

We read the statement above as saying "for
each *item* in *sequence* execute the following *statement*". As with
the `while` loop *statement* may a single simple statement or a
multipart compound statement.
