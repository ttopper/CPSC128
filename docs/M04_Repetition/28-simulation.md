# Simulation

In a simulation problem we write a program that simulates a real world
process, relying on our ability to generate random numbers to take
account of the uncertainty of real-world processes like whether newborns
are girls or boys, how long it will take to unload an airplane, the
chances a vehicle will turn left or right or go straight. If we do this
enough times we can make a reliable estimate of the probability of a
real-world event occurring.

Because we are usually simulating to find out what will happen only
because we don't already know what will actually happen they are
notoriously difficult to test. Unlike a conversion program where we know
some correct values we can use to test our program, in a simulation
correct values can be hard to find. Consider for example models of
climate change. They make quite different predictions so they can't all
be right, and the only sure test is to wait 5, 10 or 50 years to find
out which one is right.
