## Problems

1.  ### Calculating Wind Chill

    While the temperature tells us how cold the air outside is, we are
    often more interested in how quickly we will cool down. The rate at
    which we lose heat depends on the temperature outside, and also on
    the speed of the wind: the combined effect of temperature and wind
    speed is often called the wind chill. The effective
    temperature,**T<sub>e</sub>**, can be calculated using the expression,

    ![.](90_Wind_chill.png)

    where **V** is the wind speed in kilometres per hour, and **T** is
    the temperature in Celsius.

    Write a program that calculates the effective temperature. It should
    request the temperature and wind speed from the user and output the
    effective temperature.

2.  ### Converting from furlongs et al to feet

    A historian has come across a large body of material using outdated
    units of measurement. Specifically, distance measurements are given
    in terms of feet, yards (1 yard = 3 feet), chains (1 chain = 22
    yards), and furlongs (1 furlong = 10 chains). Write a program that
    will let her enter one of the historical measurements in furlongs,
    chains, yards and feet (e.g. 2 furlongs, 3 chains, 13 yards and 2
    feet) and output the equivalent measurement in feet (i.e. 1559
    feet).

3.  ### Converting from feet to furlongs et al

    The historian above now wishes to convert some measurements she has
    made in feet into these archaic units. Write a program that will
    convert from feet to furlongs, chains, yards and feet, so if she
    inputs 1559 the output should be something like:

```plaintext
1559 feet is equal to:
    2 furlongs,
    3 chains,
    13 yards, and
    2 feet.
```

## Logistics

-   Use the following naming scheme for your program files:
    `a`assignment#`p`problem#name`.py` . So Bob's solution to problem 1 on this assignment will be named `a1p1bob.py`.
