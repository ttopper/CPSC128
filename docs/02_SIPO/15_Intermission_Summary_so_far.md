# Intermission: Summary (so far)

We write programs to solve problems by,

1.  Doing a sample problem by hand (so we're sure we know how to solve
    it).

2.  Reflecting on our manual solution to identify the algorithm we are
    using.

3.  Translating our algorithm into Python.

4.  Entering, running and testing our program.

Variable names should be,

1.  Meaningful.

2.  Short.

3.  All lowercase.

Understand the difference between `print("rate")` and `print(rate)`.

A complete program includes,

1.  Documentation (at least file name, author, project).

2.  Sufficient interface elements to make it usable by someone other the
    programmer.

A program isn't finished when it runs without errors; it's finished
when you've confirmed the results are correct.
