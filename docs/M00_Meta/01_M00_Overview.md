# This week's task list!

This week you'll prepare for the course proper to make sure all the
systems you need are functioning so you are ready to get started without
distraction next Saturday. Here's what you need to do:

1.  **Read** the pages in the *Course Information* section that describe
    the course with some care. It's not exciting reading, but it is
    important, and will give you a clear idea what you are getting
    yourself into. If anything is unclear, or if you would like further
    information, post your question to the Message Board (Discussion
    Forum) on the [MyYC](http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/myyc) site.

    (Aside: The forum is preferred over email because the questions and
    answers accumulate. This way if another person has the same question
    the information is shared. Feel free to answer other people's
    questions too!)

2.  **Download and install** a Python development environment for your
    platform (Linux/Mac/Windows).

    The [Installing Python](08_InstallingPython.html) page will get you
    started on this.

    Be sure to test your installation as decribed on the page!

3.  **Familiarize** yourself with the course's two websites*. We'll
    refer to the two of them as the
    [`courses`](http://courses.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~ttopper/CPSC128.W14)
    site and the [MyYC](http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/myyc) site. The
    basic distinction is that
    [`courses`](http://courses.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~ttopper/CPSC128.W14)
    provides information like the course notes and assignments (think of
    it as the online textbook), while
    [MyYC](http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/myyc) provides logistical
    support. This table lays out it more specifically:

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      courses\                            MyYC\
      (Textbook)                          (Logistics)
      ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
      Course Notes and Videos             Message Board (Discussion forum)

      Assignment descriptions             Schedule and Calendar (so you can
                                          see when the next assignment is
                                          due!)

                                          Your Grades (so you can see how you
                                          are doing)

                                          Assignment submission (or you can
                                          use email)
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  **Log in** to the MyYC site. We've got some instructions to guide
    you in [logging in to MyYC for the first
    time](09_MyYC_Fall2013.pdf).

5.  **Set** your MyYC email to forward to your regular email address
    (unless you really want another email address to check). The MyYC
    course management system will assign you a Yukon College email
    address, but you've probably already got one you're used to using.
    You can tell MyYC to forward email from the address it assigns you
    to your regular one: [by following these
    steps](10_ConfiguringEmailForwardingInMyYC.pdf).

With those tasks out of the way you'll be ready to begin the course
itself (whew!).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Why two? The software behind MyYC a product called Campus Cruiser,
makes it awkward to post and edit course code (and this course has a lot
of that), and difficult to produce visually clean web pages.
