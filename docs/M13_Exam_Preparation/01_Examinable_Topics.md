# Examinable Topics

I will attempt to cover all the following topics on the final exam,
though not all topics will be given equal weight. For example, the
single most important skill is the ability to devise solution procedures
for problems in terms of sequence, selection (if) and iteration (for and
while).

- _Base skill_: IPO programming: Using Python to calculate values of
    formulas, e.g. wind-chill, unit conversions.
- _Core skill_: Combining if, while, for to express algorithmic
    procedures.
- _Technique_ Packaging quantities using / and %; pulling apart
    numbers using % and /.
- _Technique_ Formatting output using format strings.
- _Technique_ Knowing when to use input and when to use raw_input.
- _Technique_ Input validation using while.
- _Technique_ Using counters in programs.
- _Technique_ Using flag variables, i.e. Boolean variables that
    record state, e.g. `while not done:`, `if game_lost:`.
- _Core skill_: Defining functions. Knowing how to do it, and knowing
    when to do it.
- _Approach_ Using randomness to simulate events, e.g. four
    daughters, hockey series.
- _Data representation_: Representing things using lists, e.g. playing
    cards.
- _Data representation_: Creating and interpreting heterogeneous data
    structures (lists of lists, lists of dictionaries, dictionaries of
    lists, etc.), e.g. the cave system for Hunt the Wumpus.
- _Technique_ Processing strings using string operations, as in the
    password checking program.
- _Technique_ Processing lists, e.g. CD shuffle, `is_straight()`.
- _Technique_ Using vs changing lists, i.e. how to change a list in
    place, and how to avoid changing a list.
- _Technique_ Converting lists to strings and vice versa.
- _Data representation_: Using and processing dictionaries, e.g. for
    counting.
- _Data representation_: File processing, e.g. the temperature data
    file.
- _Approach_ Parameterizing code for generality. (And on a minor
    note, using \'constants\').
- _OOD_ object types → classes → attributes & methods (tell, ask)
- _OOP_concepts: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
- _OOP_ Defining (base) classes, reverse engineering them when
    necessary.
- _OOP_ Modifying a class via inheritance. Using inheritance to avoid
    code duplication.
- _UML_ Creating class diagrams from code, and code from class
    diagrams.
- _Software development_:
    -   By hand → Pseudocode → Python
    -   Documentation
    -   Divide and conquer
    -   Design first; code second
    -   Incremental development
    -   Testing frameworks, including doctest strings.
- _Problem domains_: Playing cards, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Hunt the
    Wumpus.
