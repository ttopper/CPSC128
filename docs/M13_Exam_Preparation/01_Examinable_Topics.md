# Examinable Topics

I will attempt to cover all the following topics on the final exam,
though not all topics will be given equal weight. For example, the
single most important skill is the ability to devise solution procedures
for problems in terms of sequence, selection (if) and iteration (for and
while).

-   *Base skill*: IPO programming: Using Python to calculate values of
    formulas, e.g. wind-chill, unit conversions.
-   *Core skill*: Combining if, while, for to express algorithmic
    procedures.
-   *Technique*: Packaging quantities using / and %; pulling apart
    numbers using % and /.
-   *Technique*: Formatting output using format strings.
-   *Technique*: Knowing when to use input and when to use raw_input.
-   *Technique*: Input validation using while.
-   *Technique*: Using counters in programs.
-   *Technique*: Using flag variables, i.e. Boolean variables that
    record state, e.g. `while not done:`, `if game_lost:`.
-   *Core skill*: Defining functions. Knowing how to do it, and knowing
    when to do it.
-   *Approach*: Using randomness to simulate events, e.g. four
    daughters, hockey series.
-   *Data representation*: Representing things using lists, e.g. playing
    cards.
-   *Data representation*: Creating and interpreting heterogeneous data
    structures (lists of lists, lists of dictionaries, dictionaries of
    lists, etc.), e.g. the cave system for Hunt the Wumpus.
-   *Technique*: Processing strings using string operations, as in the
    password checking program.
-   *Technique*: Processing lists, e.g. CD shuffle, `is_straight()`.
-   *Technique*: Using vs changing lists, i.e. how to change a list in
    place, and how to avoid changing a list.
-   *Technique*: Converting lists to strings and vice versa.
-   *Data representation*: Using and processing dictionaries, e.g. for
    counting.
-   *Data representation*: File processing, e.g. the temperature data
    file.
-   *Approach*: Parameterizing code for generality. (And on a minor
    note, using \'constants\').
-   *OOD*: object types → classes → attributes & methods (tell, ask)
-   *OOP* concepts: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
-   *OOP*: Defining (base) classes, reverse engineering them when
    necessary.
-   *OOP*: Modifying a class via inheritance. Using inheritance to avoid
    code duplication.
-   *UML*: Creating class diagrams from code, and code from class
    diagrams.
-   *Software development*:
    -   By hand → Pseudocode → Python
    -   Documentation
    -   Divide and conquer
    -   Design first; code second
    -   Incremental development
    -   Testing frameworks, including doctest strings.
-   *Problem domains*: Playing cards, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Hunt the
    Wumpus.
