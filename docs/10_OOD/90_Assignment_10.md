# Assignment 10

## Problems

1.  Complete the code given in this module to create a working Hunt the
    Wumpus program, i.e. you should fix the bugs and add the necessary 
    new code. Make as few changes to the code as possible. Ideally you 
    will just make additions to it. The file 
    [`wumpus_4_partial.py`](90_wumpus_4_partial.py) will save you some 
    typing (but doesn't contain all the code shown in wumpus_4.py, 
    you'll need to enter some of it yourself).

2.  Add two more cave systems to your Hunt the Wumpus game. It should 
    have different cave connection patterns with different numbers of 
    rooms. The cave system to be used should be chosen at random when 
    the game is begun.

3.  Add one of the following features to Hunt the Wumpus, e.g.
    *  Add a new hazard type, e.g. riddlesand, like quicksand you sink 
       into it, but you can save yourself if you can guess the secret 
       number (from 1 to 10) in three tries.
    *  Add extra arrows in some of the rooms that get automatically 
       added to your quiver when you enter the room.
    *  Have the Wumpus start out sleepy with a 0.75 chance of being 
       startled and running away, but as the game progresses have the 
       Wumpus become more alert and more likely to eat the player.
    *  Have the Wumpus move toward the player on each turn. This is a 
       way of having it hunt the player, the challenge is figuring out 
       which way is "towards".
    *  Multiple players
    *  A limited number of moves in which to finish the game
    *  A spring of visions that answers questions about the location of 
       hazards.

    Your mark will reflect the scope of your additions, and the quality 
    of your code. Be sure to describe the changes in your comments so I 
    do not overlook them when I run your program, and be sure to add 
    any "cheat" information needed to make them easy to test.


## Logistics

-   Use the following naming scheme for your program file:
    `a`*assignment#*yourname`.py` . So your code for this assignment 
    will be named `a10bob.py` (adjusted obviously to use your name).

-   Please submit your `.py` file to the Moodle dropbox.
