# Aside: Refactoring

What we did in taking two existing classes and removing their common
functionality to a new class from which they inherit is one form
ofÂ *refactoring*. Refactoring refers to processes by which we modify a
program without affecting its behaviour, i.e. we clean up its internal
structure without affecting its external behaviour. Until the 1990s
programmers just thought of it as cleaning up code, but with the
development of agile development processes and their emphasis on
iterative development refactoring became a key programming activity.
Agile developers have refined many rules and techniques for successful
refactoring.
