# Conclusion: Adding Types

Using classes to add new types to a programming language is a very
powerful technique that makes it easier (ideally simple) to write
programs in domains the language does not natively support. It is
perhaps the crowning achievement of object-oriented programming. However
such achievements are not always easy to attain. To do it well requires
close attention to the semantics of the situation you are modelling,
especially where mutable types are used.
