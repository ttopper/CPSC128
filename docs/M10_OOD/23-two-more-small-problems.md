# Two more (small) problems

## Bug: Wumpus movement

The Wumpus position is not updated properly after moving for the same reason that `Bat`s' movements were not properly updating. Fixing this will be part of your assignment.

## Missing Piece: Initialize `Pit`s

You have probably noticed that although the `Bat`s and `Wumpus` are
initialized, the `Pit`s are not. Adding this is another part of your
assignment.
